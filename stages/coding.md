## __Pipeline stage:__  Code  
### __Stage description:__  
Stage 02: Where the real work begins. Engineers pull work items according to their process and implement the required changes - be they defect fixes or new features, refactoring, or any other code change to address a requirement or feedback item.  
  
There could be a peer-review process for changes at this stage, as well as the Build stage.

if process is not docu-phobic, the changes can be documented.
