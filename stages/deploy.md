## __Pipeline stage:__  Deploy  
### __Stage description:__  
Stage 06: Following on directly from the configurations and decisions made in Release Stage, and Using the same Infrastucture as Code tools we used in Building; we can finally generate instances for actual end-users to use.  
  
This level of automation ensures our Continuous Deployment can be successful, given both the code and tools ahve already been put through their paces in the previous stages. The instances generated here are essentially mirrors of those which have already been tested.
